# **Electrolysis Process Optimization in Copper Extraction**
Copper extraction is a key sector of the metallurgy and mining industry and has a direct impact on the **electrical, electronics, automotive, construction, and renewable energy industries**.

The global demand for copper is increasing due to the growth of **electric vehicles, smart infrastructure, and renewable energy development**, making this industry more crucial than ever.

## Project Summary
This project applies machine learning techniques to optimize the electrolysis process in copper extraction. Using Random Forest Regression and Ridge Regression, we analyze industrial data to predict copper purity (%) and improve the efficiency of the electrolytic refining process.

##**The goal**:
it is to identify key factors influencing purity, reduce operational costs, and ensure higher-quality copper production by adjusting key parameters like **CuSOâ‚„ concentration, voltage, current, pH, and electrolysis time**.
